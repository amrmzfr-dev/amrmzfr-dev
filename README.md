### 🌱 Key Projects & Deployments

**Telematics System for Ozone Treatment Machines**  
- Designed and implemented a **full-stack IoT solution** to track machine usage accurately, integrating **ESP32 microcontrollers**, a **Django + SQLite backend**, and a **React.js frontend**.  
- Centralized machine control so the ESP32 directly starts and tracks the machine, time-stamping individual usage for precise billing and analytics.  
- Implemented offline data storage with **queue and retry mechanisms**, ensuring no data is lost even if Wi-Fi is unstable.  
- Deployed the full system to production using **cPanel**, connecting IoT devices, backend, and frontend into a cohesive, reliable platform.  
- Resulted in **99% reduction in data misalignment**, providing clients with accurate and trustworthy usage reports.  
- Fully self-taught and executed independently, demonstrating **end-to-end project ownership** from system architecture to deployment.  

**EV Charger Installation Mockup**  
- Built a functional mockup system for **Perodua** EV charger installation tracking using **React.js, Node.js, and Prisma**.  
- Hosted the backend on **Render.com** for testing purposes, enabling real-time contractor workflow visualization.  

**Company Website**  
- Developed and deployed the company website [www.c-zero.com](https://www.c-zero.com) using **React.js** and **cPanel**, implementing responsive UI with modern UX practices.
